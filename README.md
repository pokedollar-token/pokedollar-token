# Pokédollar
This repository contains the smart contract that defines the Pokédollar token on the Binance Smart Chain.

## What is Pokédollar?

Pokédollar is a crypto token based on the well-known ingame currency of the Pokémon main game series. Now you can finally own and use Pokédollars in the real world.

Pokédollar runs on <strong>Binance Smart Chain</strong>, which is a popular blockchain maintained by Binance, the largest crypto exchange company in the world.

## Token Goals
- Bring Web3 and crypto currencies to the Pokémon community
- Provide a flexible, safe and anonymous way to transact values inside the Pokémon community
- Increase wealth of Pokémon fans and all holders by working on permanently increasing the value of the token
- Let people finally own Pokédollars in real life and feel like a real Pokémon trainer
- Create long-term value through the currency and NFT distribution (later)

## Key Facts
